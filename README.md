# Absint - a simple abstract interpreter in haskell
I am following these lecture notes on performing AI for a simple bytecode
language: [absint winter school, Saint
petersburg](http://janmidtgaard.dk/aiws15/#links).

I could find no approachable uses of abstract interpretation, so I decided
to write one up for myself.
